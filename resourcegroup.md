# Creating an Azure Resource Group

This lab will walk you through creating an Azure Resource Group. An Azure Resource Group
is a “lifecycle boundary,” because when resources share a resource group, their lifecycles (from create, to update, to delete) are managed in an integrated way. 
Use resource groups to collect and manage all your application resources.
